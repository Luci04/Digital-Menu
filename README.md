# Digital-Menu

Welcome to the Digital Menu Server!

This server is designed to host and serve digital menus for restaurants and other food service establishments.
It provides a simple and efficient way for businesses to display their menus on electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and TVs.

The server is built using Node.js and is designed to be easy to set up and use. 
It comes with a user-friendly web interface that allows businesses to upload and manage their menus with just a few clicks.

To get started, you will need to install Node.js and the necessary dependencies.
Once the server is up and running, you can access the web interface by navigating to the designated URL in your web browser. 
From there, you can upload and manage your menus, and the changes will be automatically reflected on all connected devices.

If you have any questions or need help setting up the server, please don't hesitate to contact us. We are always happy to assist!
